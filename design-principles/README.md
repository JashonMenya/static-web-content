## Contrast: Making Things Pop
Contrast draws our eyes to things on a page. It's like using bright paint on a wall - you either match perfectly or repaint the whole wall. For effective contrast, elements must be very different.

- Helps organize information.

## Repetition: Bringing Things Together
Repeating design elements throughout strengthens your work. It's like wearing matching accessories with an outfit - it adds interest and keeps things consistent.

**Summary:**
- Creates a connected look.
- Adds visual interest.

## Alignment: Making Sense of Layout
Alignment connects elements on a page. It's like tidying up baby toys into one box. Even if elements are far apart, alignment makes your design organized and professional.

**Summary:**
- Connects elements visually.
- Makes your design look organized.

## Proximity: Keeping Related Things Close
Proximity groups items together. It's like reading a story with a logical flow. Keeping related items together helps your work be easy to follow and understand.
