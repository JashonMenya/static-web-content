## 1. **Planning** <a name="1-planning"></a>

The planning stage is where the foundation of the project is laid. Key elements of this stage include:

- **Requirements Analysis:** Gather detailed information about client goals, target audience, and feature requests. Provide valuable suggestions based on your experience.
- **Project Charter:** Summarize the gathered information and agreements in a concise document. This serves as a reference throughout the project.
- **Site Map:** Create a visual hierarchy of page organization to guide users.
- **Contracts:** Document roles, copyright, payment terms, project closure, and timelines.
- **Server Access:** Obtain server access details and set up the folder structure.
- **Software and Resources:** Identify required software and resources, including third-party media and subcontractors.

## 3. **Development** <a name="3-development"></a>

Development involves the bulk of the programming work, as well as loading content. Key steps in this phase include:

- **Build development framework:** Implement necessary frameworks or content management systems.
- **Code templates for each page type:** Create templates for different page types.
- **Develop and test special features and interactivity:** Implement interactive elements.
- **Fill with content:** Load content provided by the client or writer.

## 4. **Launch** <a name="4-launch"></a>

The purpose of the launch phase is to prepare the website for public viewing. Key steps in this phase include:

- **Polishing:** Make final design improvements.
- **Transfer to live server:** Move the website to its permanent server.
- **Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing, including code validation and cross-browser checks.

# 5. POST-LAUNCH

In the post-launch phase, business considerations come back into focus as you wrap up the project. Here are the key tasks during this phase:

- **Hand off to client:** Ensure client satisfaction and fulfillment of contractual obligations, as outlined in the project charter. A successful project should leave both parties satisfied without any lingering issues.

- **Provide documentation and source files:** Furnish comprehensive documentation, including a soft-copy site map and details on the website's framework and languages used. This transparency prevents future surprises and aids any future collaboration with other web developers.

- **Project close, final documentation:** Obtain client sign-off on the final checks, share your contact information for ongoing support, and formally close the project. Maintain an ongoing relationship with the client, as periodic check-ins can be greatly appreciated.

*Please note that this is just a sample process and can be adapted to suit your client base and design style. Processes may also vary based on the specific nature of the project, such as e-commerce websites, web applications, or digital marketing initiatives, each with unique requirements.*


# 6. DOCUMENTING THE PROCESS

Creating and maintaining two versions of your Web design process is essential: one for internal use by you or your team as a comprehensive guide for back-end work, and another for sharing with clients. These two versions should have distinct characteristics:

- **Internal Process Document:** This version should be highly detailed and include technical resources to aid in development.

- **Client-Facing Process Guide:** This version should be concise, non-technical, and provide a clear map of the entire process from project initiation to completion.

Common tools for documenting the business process include:

- Simple Microsoft Word documents
- Microsoft Visio
- Mind-mapping software like Freemind

If you're feeling ambitious, you can even consider developing your own internal web-based tool for this purpose.

# 7. USING THE PROCESS

At this point, you should have a clear understanding of what a web design process looks like, including the specifics of each phase, and you should have some idea of how to construct your own tailored web design process. While this is an important first step, it's crucial not to overlook the next aspect: understanding how a well-defined process can enhance your overall business and how to effectively utilize it when approaching and interacting with clients.

# 8. REFINING THE PROCESS

It's important to recognize that the web design process will vary from one designer to another and from one project to the next. Therefore, it's essential to develop a process that suits your specific needs and those of your team. Only when the process aligns with your requirements will it truly be beneficial. After all, freelancers often cater to vastly different target markets.

While bulleted lists provide a foundation, the web design process can be much more intricate and valuable. Many resources, tools, and links shared on web design blogs and through social media platforms like Twitter can enhance various stages of the process. An exceptionally useful way to refine your process is by incorporating resource links into each phase and creating your own resources, including branded document templates.

Some commonly used documents by freelancers include:

- Invoices
- Project charters
- Documentation for hand-off to clients
- User account details
- Database table charts
- Site maps

# 9. FILES AND ARCHIVE

Documenting and maintaining an organized file archive is of paramount importance. While these tasks may seem mundane, they play a vital role when tax season approaches or when your small freelance venture begins to expand. Being disciplined about efficiency in your work and time management can never be overstated.

You have several options for achieving this:

- **Standard Document Format and Folder Structure:** Consider establishing a consistent document format and folder structure for all your clients. This uniformity simplifies document management and retrieval.

- **Client List and Project Archive:** Maintain a list or archive of previous clients and project files. This record can serve as a valuable resource for future reference.

- **Accounting Practices:** Depending on the scale of your freelance work, consider implementing small-business accounting practices. These practices can help you manage finances and file taxes with ease.

Efficient file management and archiving are not only beneficial for your current projects but also for the long-term sustainability and growth of your freelance business.

# 10. A PROCESS PUTS THE CLIENT AT EASE

For many clients, Web development can be somewhat of a black box, even after efforts to educate them on its methods. To them, they provide requirements, suggestions, and content, and then, at some point, a website begins to take shape. They may remain largely unaware of significant aspects of the process, such as the distinction between design and development. Having an organized and concise process at your disposal can help structure a client's thoughts and alleviate their concerns. It can also aid in their comprehension of how their investment is being utilized.

As a freelancer, outlining your basic process is often the initial step you take with potential or new clients. A brief, high-level discussion about "how it works" provides a framework for the entire project. Following this discussion, the client gains a better understanding of what is expected from them, what deliverables to anticipate at specific points in the timeline, and the nature of work you will undertake during the project. Above all, such discussions can proactively address any potential miscommunication or confusion.

Designers sometimes forget that most people have limited knowledge of their profession, including the associated terminology and the steps involved in producing a final product. Starting with a client who may have little prior knowledge can be a valuable opportunity to bridge this gap.

# 11. IT’S A BUSINESS

Web design is fundamentally a business, and the steps outlined here form the foundation of effective small-business management. As your client base, staff, or contractors expand, your to-do list grows exponentially, and the challenge of keeping everything organized becomes apparent. It's essential to take a step back and invest time in discovering tools and strategies that can enhance your efficiency. An expanded process document serves as an excellent initial step on this path.

## TIPS

Here are some valuable tips to consider:

- **Seek Non-Technical Feedback:** Have a non-technical friend review your process. If it makes sense to them, it's likely to make sense to your client.

- **Leverage Existing Processes:** Use the processes of other designers as a starting point to build or refine your own. Explore related resource links for inspiration.

- **Utilize Document Templates and Web Apps:** Incorporate document templates and web applications into your process. This approach saves time and enhances your professionalism.

Remember that your web design venture is not just a creative endeavor but also a business, and managing it efficiently is key to long-term success.
