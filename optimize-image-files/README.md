# 🌐 Optimizing Image Files: Extended Guide 

Welcome to a comprehensive guide on optimizing image files! In this extended version, we will cover all aspects of image optimization, ensuring that your images are perfectly optimized for the web. 🚀

## 🎯 Focus Areas

We're going to cover all the points from the image optimization checklist, exploring both the art and science behind image optimization.

### 1. **Prefer Vector Formats**
   - Embrace vector images as they are resolution and scale independent, making them a perfect fit for a multi-device and high-resolution world.

### 2. **Minify and Compress SVG Assets**
   - Minimize and compress SVG assets by removing unnecessary metadata and configuring servers to apply GZIP compression for SVG assets.

### 3. **Pick Best Raster Image Format**
   - Determine the functional requirements and select the format that best suits each particular asset. We will be using Photoshop to create jpgs, gifs, png-8, and png-24 files.

### 4. **Experiment with Quality Settings**
   - Don’t be afraid to experiment with the "quality" settings of raster formats to achieve significant byte savings without compromising on visual quality.

### 5. **Remove Unnecessary Metadata**
   - Utilize appropriate tools to strip unnecessary metadata like geo information and camera information from raster images.

### 6. **Serve Scaled Images**
   - Resize images on the server to ensure that the "display" size is as close as possible to the "natural" size of the image.

### 7. **Automate Image Optimization**
   - Invest in automated tools and infrastructure to ensure that all your image assets are always optimized.

## 🛠 Practical Assignment

- Open the provided PSD file.
- Use 'save for web (legacy)' to save each layer as gif, jpg, png-8, and png-24.
- You will have 40 images in total (10 layers × 4 formats).
- Identify and label the best file format that offers a balance between size and quality.

**Note**: For png-8 and gif, ensure the artboard has a white background to drop out the background on logos.

## 🌈 Tips & Tricks

- Automation is your friend. Aim to automate repetitive tasks to streamline the optimization process.
- Naming convention matters. Ensure that file names are in lowercase, meaningful, and use hyphens instead of spaces for better SEO.
