## Objective
The goal of this project is to create three additional icons in Adobe Illustrator for [Motokazi's website](http://www.motokazie.com/mk/mk_about.html), ensuring they are cohesive with the existing icon set provided by the client.

## Assignment

1. **Research and Sketch**: Investigate the current Motokazi iconography. Sketch potential icon ideas and select the top three that represent the Motokazi brand effectively.
2. **Base Set Selection**: Choose a base set of icons that appeals to you and aligns with the client's style. Obtain these for reference via download or screen capture.
3. **Illustrator Setup**: Start a new document in Illustrator with the following specifications:
    - Size: 8.5"x11"
    - Color Space: RGB
    - Navigate to `File > Document Color Mode > RGB` to set up your workspace.

## Guidelines

- **Placing Base Image**: Use `File > Place` to insert your chosen base set image into the document.
- **Design Consistency**: Craft your icons to match the line weight and style of the base set.
- **Color Matching**: Utilize identical color swatches to ensure visual harmony among all icons.

## Exporting Icons

- **Individual Export**:
    - After creating your icons, export each one as an SVG file.
    - For this, go to `File > Save As > SVG`.
- **Using Asset Exporter**:
    - Drag each icon onto the asset exporter panel while holding 'Alt' or 'Option' to add it as a single asset.
    - Repeat this for all three icons.
    - Set the file format to SVG.
    - Select all three icons (indicated by a blue line).
    - Click 'Export'.

## Submission

Upload the Illustrator file (.ai) and the three SVG files to the designated Icon assignment folder on d2l.
