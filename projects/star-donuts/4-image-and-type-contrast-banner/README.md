# Starr Donuts Banner Ad Creation Guide 🍩

Create an eye-catching Twitter post banner ad for **Starr Donuts**, ensuring effective contrast between type and background while preserving the style and message coherent with the brand.

## 🎨 Contrast Techniques 

### Background 
Leverage these strategies to enhance contrast and possibly reduce file size:
- **Color Modes:** Grayscale, monotone, duotone
- **Overlay:** Solid, transparent, or gradient
- **Opacity:** Reduced opacity or adjustment layer > Brightness and Contrast
- **Space:** Natural solid space or added through image placement
- **Design Techniques:** Positive and negative spaces, blur, filter, content-aware scale and fill 

### Text 
Enhance text visibility and aesthetic appeal through:
- **Styling:** Stroke, color/value contrast, drop shadow, heavy weight
- **Size:** Ensure letter size is legible and commanding 
- **Typeface:** Select a font that aligns with the brand's vibe

### In Between 
Position a box in between the background and text for additional contrast and emphasis:
- **Box Types:** Opaque, transparent, blurred
- **Box Color:** Apply soft or hard color paint 

## 🚀 Process & Deliverables 

1. **Canvas Creation:** In Photoshop, create a file with dimensions 1024 x 512 px.
2. **Image Placement:** Embed 4 images (File > Place) and modify or position each for optimal type/image combination.
3. **Type Layers:** Add 4 type layers using "Starr Donuts Out of this World Delights." Ensure each utilizes varied techniques for contrast.
4. **Layer Naming:** Clearly label the layers (image 1, image 2, etc.) for streamlined review and feedback.

### Notes 
- Focus on demonstrating different type/image contrast techniques in each composition.
- No need to add logos; use only the provided text.
- Pull images from any source, ensuring they're modified according to demonstrated methods.

## 🚦 Guidelines for Submission 

Ensure that each image layer correlates with its corresponding type layer. The ease of identifying pairings expedites the review process, providing you with faster feedback and potential adjustments.
