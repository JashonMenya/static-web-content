## Part 1: Compression and File Formats üõ†

### Assignment Task:
- **Export Files**: Utilize `File > Export > Save for Web (legacy)` in Photoshop, aiming for a variety of compression options and formats.
- **Layer Handling**: Manage each of the 10 layers in the provided Photoshop file separately, ensuring distinct handling for each image.

### Instructions:
- Save each layer in the following formats ensuring that each saved file has a width of 800px and is in sRGB color space:
   - **JPEG**: `image1.jpg`
   - **GIF**: `image1.gif`
   - **PNG-8**: `image1-8.png`
   - **PNG-24**: `image1-24.png`
   
**Special Note**: For images 7 and 8, ensure that you save them with transparency.

## Part 2: Analyzing and Choosing the Best Format üßê

### Assignment Task:
- Analyze each image, comparing file sizes and visual quality.
