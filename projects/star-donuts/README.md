we are going to use the design process to create some web content for our first client, Starr Donuts. Below is some information you got from the first meeting with them, 

Starr Donuts is a small family-owned bakery (they have been around for 40 years) in Rosemount that sells donuts, muffins, bread etc but specializes in wedding cakes. They do not sell online but do all of their business at their bakery. They do want to have orders processed through the web site but will not mail anything. Budget is $3000. No content has been furnished to you. They would like this done in 2 months.

Starr Donuts is a small one store bakery that isn't looking for big changes just a presence that will make things smoother and help them serve customers better and more consistently. They want to make sure their good reputation stays intact, they stay busy and profitable and to make sure people know about their wedding cakes. They also want to cut down on phone calls asking basic questions like hours etc and shorten how long it takes people to decide on what they want to order. Their tagline is “Out of This World Delights”. You can make up information as necessary to make a complete brief to work with going forward. We will use them for a couple more weeks.

Part 1 of your assignment is to create a creative or client brief for Starr Donuts. This basically is the recap of the meeting you first had with them to make sure that everyone heard and understood the same information before going forward with the rest of the design process. It also includes the information you would like to add based on your initial research and strategies . For part 1 of your assignment, I want you to answer the following questions for Starr Donuts for your creative brief:

What does the client need and why?
